# academia-java-api
A project to teach REST APIs with Java and Spring Boot

# The Academy
We are going to build a Customer REST API in order to provide a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage Customer's data. 

There will be a Swagger Proof provided in the base project.

# The Challenge
The base project has an error. There will be a prize to those who identify, solve and send a PR (Pull Reques) to the base project.

# Concepts
- What is a REST API?
Is an application that uses the HTTP protocol to communicate and expose system data.

- Why should we use a REST API?
In order to provide communication and integration between systems.

- How can we implement a REST API?
There are many ways to do this. In Santander we have been using Java and Spring Boot framework.
